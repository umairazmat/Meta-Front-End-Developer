/* Task 1: Using the logical && operator
You are coding an RPG game, where each character has certain skill levels based on the value saved in their score.

Create a variable named  score and set it to  8

Use console.log() that includes the string "Mid-level skills:" and compares the score variable to above 0 and below 10 using the && operator

The expected output in the console should be: "Mid-level skills: true". */

var score = 8;
console.log("Mid-level skills:" , score > 0 && score < 10);

/* Task 2: Using the logical || operator
Imagine you are coding a video game. Currently, you’re about to code some snippets related to the game over condition.

You need to code a new variable named timeRemaining and set it to 0. You also need to code a new variable named energy and set it to 10.

Next, you should write a piece of code that could be used to determine if the game is over, based on whether either the value of the timeRemaining variable is 0 or the value of the energy variable is 0.

Complete the task using the following steps:

Declare the variable timeRemaining, and assign the value of 0 to it.

Declare the variable energy, and assign the value of 10 to it.

Console log the following parameters: "Game over: ", and timeRemaining == 0 || energy == 0

Note that the expected output in the console should be: "Game over: true".*/

var timeRemaining  = 0;
var energy = 10;
console.log("Game over: ", timeRemaining == 0 || energy == 0 )

/*Task 3: Using the modulus operator, %, to test if a given number is odd

You need to code a small program that takes a number and determines if it's an even number (like 2, 4, 6, 8, 10).

To achieve this task, you need to declare six variables, as follows:

The first variable, named num1,  should be assigned a number value of 2.

The second variable, named num2, should be assigned a number value of 5.

The third variable, named test1, should be assigned the calculation of num1 % 2. Note: executing this code will return a number.

The fourth variable, named test2, should be assigned the calculation of num2 % 2. Note: executing this code will also return a number.

The fifth variable, named result1, should be assigned the result of comparing if the number stored in the test1 variable is not equal to 0, in other words, this: test1 == 0.

The sixth variable, named result2, should be assigned the result of comparing if the number stored in the test2 variable is not equal to 0, in other words, test2 == 0.

Run console log two times after you've set the variables:

The first console log should have the following code between parentheses: "Is", num1, "an even number?", result1

The second console log should have the following code between parentheses: "Is", num2, "an even number?", result2

Note: The output to the console should be as follows:

Is 2 an even number? true

Is 5 an even number? false */

var num1 = 2;
var num2 = 5;
var test1 = num1 % 2;
var test2 = num2 % 2;
var result1 = test1 == 0;
var result2 = test2 == 0;
console.log("Is", num1, "an even number?", result1);
console.log("Is", num2, "an even number?", result2);

/* Task 4: Add numbers using the + operator
Console log the result of adding two numbers, 5 and 10, using the + operator.

Note: This task should be completed on a single line of code. The output in the console should be 15.

12 */

console.log(5 + 10); // 15

/* Task 5: Concatenate numbers and strings using the + operator
Code three variables:

The first variable should be a string with the following value: "Now in ". Name the variable now.

The second variable should be a number with the value: 3. Name the variable three.

The third variable should a string with the following value: "D!". Name the variable d.

Console log the following code: now + three + d.

Note: The expected output should be: "Now in 3D!". */

var now = "Now in ";
var three = 3;
var d = "D!"
console.log(now + three + d); // "Now in 3D!"

/* Task 6: Use the += operator to accumulate values in a variable
Code a new variable and name it counter, assigning it to the value of 0.

On the next line, use the += operator to increase the value of counter by 5.

On the next line, use the += operator to increase the value of counter by 3.

On the fourth line, console log the value of the counter variable.

Note: The output value should be 8. */

var counter = 0;
counter += 5;
counter += 3;
console.log(counter); // 8
